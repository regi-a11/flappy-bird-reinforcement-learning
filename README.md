# Training a Reinforcement Learning Agent to Play Flappy Bird

> **About this fork**
>
> This is a fork of [LukasDrews97/flappy-bird-reinforcement-learning](https://github.com/LukasDrews97/flappy-bird-reinforcement-learning). The training code, configs, experiments and results below are all Lukas Drews's work. The Flappy Bird Gym environment in `flappy_bird_gym/` comes from [Talendar/flappy-bird-gym](https://github.com/Talendar/flappy-bird-gym) by Gabriel Nogueira (MIT License, see `LICENSE`).
>
> **What the project does:** it trains agents to play Flappy Bird with two reinforcement-learning algorithms from [Stable-Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3), A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic) and PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization). It covers two kinds of game input:
> - the **simple** environment, where the agent sees just two numbers: the horizontal distance to the next pipe and the vertical distance to the centre of its gap;
> - the **RGB** environment, where the agent sees the screen itself, converted to grayscale, resized to 84×84 and stacked 4 frames deep (8 in one config) so it can sense motion.
>
> Each can be paired with an MLP or a CNN policy. Every run is described by a YAML file in `config/`. There is also Optuna-based hyperparameter tuning (`hyperparameter_tuning.py`) over learning rate, `n_steps` and gamma. The best result reported below is 1,840 frames survived, by PPO with an MLP policy on the simple environment after tuning.
>
> **Changes in this fork**
> - `requirements.txt`: removed `pywin32==304`, which exists only on Windows and makes `pip install -r requirements.txt` fail on macOS and Linux. Also removed `scikit-learn==1.1.2` and `scipy==1.9.0`, which none of the project's Python files import.
> - The rest of the code is unchanged from upstream.

In this project, I trained multiple agents to play the game Flappy Bird using Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). There are two environments to choose from, one using only player coordinates to represent state (simple environment) and one using pixel values (rgb environment). Furthermore, there are two policies to choose from, one using a multilayer perceptron (mlp policy) and one using convolution neural networks (cnn policy).

$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure
### Root-Folder
|File/Folder               |Description|
|---|---|
|`train_agent.py`|Train or run an reinforcement agent using config file.|
|`hyperparameter_tuning.py`|Run hyperparameter tuning given parameters.|
|`config`|Folder containing training/run configs.|
|`flappy_bird_gym`|Folder containing the flappy bird gym, originally created by [@Talendar] and slightly modified by  [@doravalerie] and me.|
|`requirements.txt`|Lists all packages used for the project. Designed to be used with pip.|
|`imgs`|This folder contains images displayed in this file.|
|`README.md`|This file.|


### Config files
Training and runtime parameters are stored in a yaml file. It must be stored in the config folder having the following structure:
```
type: [simple/rgb]
hyperparameter:
└───algorithm: [A2C/PPO]
└───policy: [MLP/CNN]
└───learning_rate: float
└───gamma: float
checkpoints:
└───prefix: str
total_timesteps: int
eval_freq: int
frame_stack: Optional[int]
```

## Train an agent
To train an agent, run `train_agent.py` with the train flag and specify the config file:

```bash
$ python .\train_agent.py --train --config .\config\my_config.yml
```

A new folder within `saved_models` and `logs` will be created for the results.


## Run a trained agent
To run a trained agent, run `train_agent.py` with the test flag, specify the config file and the trained model file:

```bash
$ python .\train_agent.py --test --config .\config\my_config.yml --model_path .\saved_models\my_model\best_models\best_model.zip
```


## Hyperparameter Tuning
To start hyperparameter tuning, run `hyperparameter_tuning.py` with the follwing arguments:

```bash
$ python .\hyperparameter_tuning.py --algorithm a2c --timesteps 5000000 --env rgb --policy cnn --trials 20
```

|Parameter|Description|Possible Values|Required|
|---|---|---|---|
|`--algorithm`|Algorithm to use to train the model.|`a2c`, `ppo`|Yes|
|`--timesteps`|Maximal number of timesteps to train a model while tuning.|int|Yes|
|`--env`|Which environment to use.|`simple`, `rgb`|Yes|
|`--policy`|Which policy to use.|`mlp`, `cnn`|Yes|
|`--trials`|The number of different tuning trials.|int|Yes|


A new folder within `saved_models_hyperparameter` and `logs_hyperparameter` will be created for the results.
## Results
The performance of a model is measured in the number of survived steps (frames).
